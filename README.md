## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Serg, in my day to day job I write apps for iPhone, iPad, and taste a bit of team-leading. I often run some crazy things like using Swift on Linux, Windows, conducting or participating Hackathons, trying completely different stacks, reverse engineering software and hardware, or building my own. The latter one is especially successful and I have now dozen of microcontrollers around in useful nets of devices, helping me to keep up with the routine.

The easiest to reach me is Twitter and Telegram, except for recruitment purposes â€“ direct this to the email. Come also support me on [Patreon](https://twitter.com/ReDetection) so I can implement more ideas.
